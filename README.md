# Transportation-Analysis
üöç Excited to share my latest project on transportation analysis! üöç

I recently conducted a comprehensive analysis of transportation data, focusing on optimizing bus routes and improving rider experience. Here's a glimpse into the key tables and insights from my analysis:

1. Bus Table: Contains information about buses, including bus ID, bus number, route ID, and capacity.

2. Rider Table: Includes details about riders such as rider ID, age, gender, and occupation.

3. Fact Table: Provides a record of bus trips with details like record ID, bus ID, date (2023 and 2024), time, number of riders, and rider ID.

4. Route Table: Stores data about routes, including route ID, route name, start location, end location, trip fee, take-off time, and arrival time.

Using advanced data analysis techniques, I extracted valuable insights from this data, including:
- Optimal bus routes based on ridership and capacity utilization.
- Demographic trends of riders, helping in targeted marketing strategies.
- Time-based analysis for scheduling and operational efficiency.
